To change the theme of the software center, pursue the following steps:
1 make a backup of your '/usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/css/softwarecenter.css' file

2 In that file change the first two lines to:
'@define-color light-aubergine #121212;'
'@define-color super-light-aubergine #1C1C1C;'

3 make a backup of your '/usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/art/stipple.png' file

4 let the included 'stipple.png' of the theme take the place of the original

If you do not follow these steps, the software center will stay in its original light background which does not look good with the light blue font of the theme. If you know a more elegant solution to this problem please let me know.
